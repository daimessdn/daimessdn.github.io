## my personal native-like terminal website

Welcome to my personal website. This is my primary website
domain of github.io (daimessdn.github.io). Here are some
features you can play around.

_By the way, I'm still not sure what the hell I'm creating about._

- Basic native terminal
- Added some common Linux/Unix commands (`ls`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `exit`,
  `clear`, `reset`, `history`, `reboot`, etc.)
  - For more information, type `help` and <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Added some external commands
  - `portfoflio`: displays my portfolio (I'm not sure you'll get
    something from typing it, might be worth to try).
    There are special arguments you might find out, `sudo` command
    might not working since I didn't create the command yet.
